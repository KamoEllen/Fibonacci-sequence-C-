# Fibonacci-sequence-C-
Fibonacci sequence up to a certain number and then prints the result to the console:

This program uses a for loop to iterate over the numbers in the sequence and a couple of variables to store the previous two numbers in the sequence. The program prints each number as it is computed and then updates the variables to store the next two numbers in the sequence.

In order to make this program more complex, you could add additional features such as input validation, error handling, or additional functionality such as computing the Fibonacci sequence to a number entered by the user.
